# Omega-Mage
Using Omega Mage Prototype from Gibson's Book

Tried to implement 3 new spells, but couldn't figure out how to do it exactly.
Tried making:
  the green earth-element a healing spell
  the air element as a shield
  the water element to speed down a path
  
Since I wasn't able to do it, I just used the same type of spell as the fire element as attacking
and just changed the color to match the elements and the way the linear spells will look when activated...
